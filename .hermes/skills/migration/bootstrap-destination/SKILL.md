description: >
  Use at M2 PLAN, after the evidence bundle and before the first
  verification, to produce the deterministic destination baseline for the
  Spring-compatibility path: import the frozen legacy source into the
  destination tree, rewrite the pom from the compat-mapping catalog and
  the pins (Quarkus BOM and plugin, starters and JDBC drivers to
  extensions, compiler/surefire pins), rename mapped property keys, and
  delete the @SpringBootApplication main class. Pure stdlib
  (ElementTree, line-based properties); no third-party tool, no regex, no
  model. Idempotent. Refuses without the catalog, the pins, or the frozen
  copy. Never run inside an M3 card.

# Bootstrap the destination (step 0 of fix-until-green)

Owns `evidence/producers/bootstrap.json` and the first product commit of
the run (the loop's baseline). After this step the compiler, the tests,
and the MTA rescan produce the real plan: the work list.

## Procedure

```bash
python3 "${HERMES_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/probe-bom-managed.py" --root /projects/modernized
python3 "${HERMES_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/bootstrap-destination.py" --root /projects/modernized
```

The probe measures, with Maven's own `help:effective-pom`, which artifacts
the pinned BOM manages (`evidence/build/bom-managed.json`); network once.

0. **settings** — refuses `MAVEN_SETTINGS_MISSING` unless `.mvn/maven.config`
   wires `-s .mvn/settings.xml` and that file declares the catalog's
   `maven_settings.profile` (Red Hat GA repository: the pinned
   `com.redhat.quarkus.platform` artifacts are not on Maven Central, and
   Maven 3 does not auto-read `.mvn/settings.xml`).
1. **import** — copies `pom.xml` and `src/` from the freeze receipt's
   `analysis_copy` (byte-identical to the frozen legacy mount) into the
   destination root. Packages are kept: the compat path does not rename.
   A file listed in `decisions.yaml` `retired_sources` (an accepted ADR,
   one path, one reason) is never imported and, if present, deleted and
   recorded as `source.delete` with the ADR; a retired path the frozen
   legacy never had blocks `RETIRED_SOURCE_MISSING`.
2. **pom** — from `.hermes/planning/catalogs/compat-mapping.json` and
   `.hermes/pins.json`: removes `spring-boot-starter-parent`, imports the
   pinned `quarkus-bom`, maps every listed starter and JDBC driver to its
   Quarkus extension, removes the Spring Boot plugin, adds the pinned
   Quarkus plugin and compiler/surefire pins. A Spring Boot dependency
   with no catalog row **stays in the pom** and is recorded as
   `UNMAPPED_DEPENDENCY`: removing it could drop runtime auto-configuration
   that still compiles. Removing the parent also removes its version
   management: a version-less dependency the BOM manages stays
   version-less; one it does not manage is pinned to the version the
   legacy build resolved (`managed_versions` in the build receipt, from
   the legacy effective pom) and recorded as `pom.pin-legacy-version`;
   no legacy version → `VERSION_UNMANAGED`; no probe → `BOM_PROBE_MISSING`.
3. **config** — renames mapped `application*.properties` keys and maps
   documented values (`create-drop` → `drop-and-create`); keys with no
   Quarkus equivalent are commented out and recorded.
4. **main** — deletes the class the JDK model marks
   `@SpringBootApplication` only when it is a trivial launcher (no fields,
   no other annotation, no method but `main`). A launcher that declares
   beans or configuration is kept and recorded as `MAIN_CLASS_NOT_TRIVIAL`.
5. **receipt** — every change, every block, the catalog digest, the bundle
   digest and the pins used. A block exits 1 and keeps admission
   `INCONCLUSIVE` (`BOOTSTRAP_BLOCKED`) until a catalog row or an ADR
   resolves it; nothing is removed on a block. Admission also refuses
   `BOOTSTRAP_MISSING` / `BOOTSTRAP_STALE`.

Then `build-worklist` verifies the tree and records the baseline.

## Verification

- `scripts/../fix-until-green/scripts/fix-until-green.test.py` proves the
  pom/properties/main-class outcome on the http specimen and that a
  second run changes nothing.

## Scripts

- `scripts/probe-bom-managed.py` — what the pinned BOM manages (Maven effective pom → `evidence/build/bom-managed.json`)
- `scripts/bootstrap-destination.py` — the transform + receipt
- `scripts/bootstrap-destination.test.py` — selftest (trivial launcher deleted; launcher with behavior kept + block; unmapped starter kept + block; second run preserves the tree)

## Pitfalls

- Editing the mapping to "make it compile". The catalog is a versioned
  contract of documented Quarkus mappings; anything else is a work-list
  item for the loop.
- Running it on a tree that already has accepted loop steps: the import
  is idempotent, but a re-bootstrap after steps is a new run.
