# M1 ANALYZE paved-road (index)

This skill is the **M1 procedure index**. Ordered mandated steps live in
`steps.json`. `audit.json` is generated from that file — do not edit it
by hand. Do not copy subskill SKILL.md bodies into this file.

Pin **only** this leaf (`--skill paved-road-m1`). Subskills load via
`skill_view` from the step list. Producer of artifact `m1-analyze` is
`assemble-evidence-bundle` (`evidence/planning/evidence-bundle.json`),
the root of the planner digest chain (SAD §6).

## When to Use

- This card is **M1 ANALYZE**.
- **Not** M2 PLAN (`paved-road-m2`).
- **Not** dest-init mint (`dispatch-phase`).

## Procedure

1. Read `steps.json`. Follow that listed order:
   freeze → build → JDK-model inventory → bytecode (optional) → context probe
   → MTA → assemble → attach.
   - `skill` — `skill_view` that leaf and follow its SKILL.md.
   - `native` — run the named script under `.hermes/kernel/`
     (`kanban_attach.py --task "$HERMES_KANBAN_TASK" --exec`).
2. KEEP paths on the step must exist under the workspace root.
3. A producer that records `status: unpinned` (structure extractor) or a build that
   records `outcome: failure` is **evidence**, not a defect to repair.
   extractor unpinned / JDK mismatch → `kanban_block` (kind `needs_input`, the pin is an
   ADR). Build failure → continue; the ledger makes it planning-only.
4. Happy-path terminator: `kanban_request_review` (reviewer `reviewer`), then end the turn. A later nudge to finish is already satisfied by the review handoff; do not answer it with `kanban_complete` (K2 refuses it for the implementer) or `kanban_block`.
5. `kanban_block` for external/platform (MaaS 500, missing key, GPU).
6. Reviewer runs `scripts/assert-paved-road-audit.py --log <official> --root <ws>`.
   `--log` must be `kanban/logs/t_*.log` (or a land-time `fixtures/**/official.log`).

## Gotchas

- Silence fails. An unmatched `[exit 1]` on a mandated needle fails.
  A later clean invocation of the *same* needle clears an earlier red.
  Do not last-wins across different needles.
- `inventory-legacy-surface` precedes `scan-with-mta`: the MTA handoff
  refuses (AR-4.1) without `evidence/entry-point-inventory.json`.
- `derive-legacy-boot3` is **not** an M1 step. The baseline is the
  frozen original source; a Boot 3 derivation is an execution-side
  transformation only.
- Path mention / grep / cat of a SKILL.md is not `skill_view`.
- Do not `kanban daemon --force`.

## Self-test

`python3 scripts/selftest.py` (golden only, never on a card): steps.json ↔ audit.json sync, order contract, fixture PASS/REFUSE set, and the paved-road coverage lint.
