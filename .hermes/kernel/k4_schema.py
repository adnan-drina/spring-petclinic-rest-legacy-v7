"""K4 converter/mint schema (AD-019 §4 K4, work-list model; SAD v3 §8).

Not a skill. Not dest-apply. Input is ``evidence/planning/worklist.json``
plus an ADMITTED ``admission-receipt.json`` — never a partition, never a
DAG, never prose. K4 emits exactly one card: the head cluster, or M4
VERIFY when the list is empty and nothing is deferred. Does not import
create_task. Does not shell ``hermes kanban`` except from ``k4_mint.py --exec``.
