# Agent Guide

This is a corporate Quarkus **migration** scaffold. The workspace holds two
projects: you migrate the legacy application in `/projects/legacy` into this
repository (`/projects/modernized`).

## Workspace rules

- `/projects/legacy` — the application being migrated (**legacy@2.x**
  provenance). **READ-ONLY**: never modify, commit, or push it. It is not
  registered anywhere and has no write credentials.
- `/projects/modernized/.derived/legacy-at-3` — **legacy@3.x**, a
  pure derivation of the RO mount (inside the dest tree so the fence can
  inspect it). Produced once, hashed, and frozen. Never edit. Do not add
  `/projects/.derived` to `K2_ALLOW_ROOT`.
- `/projects/modernized` — this repository. All new code, tests, and commits
  happen here, and only here.

## Project identity

- Quarkus application on the Red Hat build (`com.redhat.quarkus.platform` BOM
  **3.27.3.SP1**), Java 21, Maven (no wrapper — use `mvn`).
- Package root: `com.demo`.
- **Spring-compatibility path first** (ADR-001 in `decisions.yaml`): the
  `quarkus-spring-*` extensions the bootstrap adds from `compat-mapping.json`
  are the destination baseline. Use native Quarkus APIs only where the
  compatibility extension documents no support (Quarkus does not start a
  Spring `ApplicationContext`: no `@Conditional`, `@Profile`,
  `BeanPostProcessor`, `@Import`; Spring Boot test features are
  unsupported → `@QuarkusTest`). Never add an extension outside the catalog.
- Default CDI scope for services and repositories: `@ApplicationScoped`.
- Prefer constructor injection; config via `@ConfigProperty` / `%profile` keys
  (or `QUARKUS_PROFILE`) — do not invent Spring-style `application-*.properties`
  trees on the destination.
- REST resources under `/api/`; JSON via Jackson. If health exists, it
  belongs at `/q/health` (`/q/*` deliberately sits outside the application
  root path). That is a target convention, not a story to invent.
- Pattern cards (on demand): skill `spring-to-quarkus-patterns`.
- Extension add/rm (on demand): skill `manage-quarkus-extensions` (RH BOM policy;
  versions in `.hermes/pins.json` only).

## Build and test

The container's default Java is 17; this project targets 21. Set once per
shell:

```bash
export JAVA_HOME="${JAVA_HOME_21}" && export PATH="${JAVA_HOME}/bin:${PATH}"

mvn quarkus:dev          # dev mode with hot reload
mvn -q clean test        # always clean — incremental builds pass on stale classes
mvn -q clean verify      # full build, mirrors the pipeline
```

## Delivery gate

Every push to `main` runs this project's pipeline: Maven build → SonarQube
quality gate → image build → deploy. The bars are exact: **zero new
violations**, **≥ 80% new-code line coverage** (tests ship with the code),
**≤ 3% duplicated new lines**. Never weaken tests or suppress rules to pass.

The repository must **build self-contained**: the pipeline resolves from
Maven Central and in-repo sources only — it cannot see your workspace. Your
local green is not the factory's green until the build passes without
workspace state.

## Hermes — classify, then place

**Kind determines home.** Map: `.hermes/LAYOUT.md`. Do not add top-level
`scripts/` or `.hermes/home/scripts/` for new procedures.

| Kind | Home |
|------|------|
| Standing conventions | this `AGENTS.md` only |
| Identity | dest-user: authored `.hermes/SOUL.md` → base `$HERMES_HOME/SOUL.md`. Workers: `.hermes/config/profiles/{orchestrator,implementer,reviewer}.SOUL.md` → that profile's `$HERMES_HOME/SOUL.md`. Official: one SOUL.md per profile home. |
| Guidance procedures | `.hermes/skills/<category>/<name>/` (card-attachable) |
| Domain gates G-1..G-4 | skill `check-domain-parity` |
| M4 verdict JSON producer | skill `compose-m4-verdict` |
| M4/M5 verdict routing | skill `check-release-readiness` |
| M4 pinned-gate evidence | skill `assert-pinned-gates-ran` |
| M4 retrievable `src/` + `pom.xml` | skill `assert-retrievable-tree` |
| Fence-evasion detector (observation, not a boundary) | skill `assert-no-fence-evasion` |
| Run / phase data | `evidence/` |
| Planning contracts | `.hermes/planning/` (schemas, catalogs incl. `compat-mapping.json`, MTA rules, `decisions.example.yaml`); the work-list planner `.hermes/lib/planner/`; the only human input is `decisions.yaml` (platform, attempt threshold, ADR-retired items) |
| Destination POM authoring | skill `author-destination-pom` |
| Seat config template | `.hermes/config/config.yaml.template` (no secrets) |
| Dest worker profiles | `.hermes/config/profiles/{orchestrator,implementer,reviewer}.yaml.template` plus sibling `{name}.SOUL.md` |

### Paths

| Path | Role |
|------|------|
| `$HERMES_MANAGED_DIR` | Platform config + secrets — not in this repo |
| `$HERMES_HOME` | Runtime (sessions/logs gitignored). Relocated dest-time. |
| `.hermes/skills/` | Scaffold golden **guidance** skills on `skills.external_dirs` |
| Seat Kanban assignees | M1/M2/M3 implementer; same-card review → `reviewer` on M1/M2 only (loop cards complete on the recorded verdict). Dest mint-writer / mint-verifier cards are retired; M2 runs `.hermes/kernel/k4_mint.py` as CLI. Official `--assignee` (hermes-kanban). Not `default`. OBJECT EX-4 `analyzer`/`planner`/`validator`. dest orchestrator disables `file`/`terminal`/`code_execution`/`skills` — it cannot run M2 PLAN, M4, or paved-road audit. `reviewer` has `kanban`+`terminal` only. |
| Hermes live config | **Not yours to change.** Factory-owned Managed Scope. Raise typed `needs_input` |
| Phase DAG | Kanban `--parent` / `link` graph (`hermes kanban show --json`) |
| `~/.hermes/skills/` | dest-user `/home/user/.hermes/skills` on `external_dirs` (dest-init literal). Not worker `Path.home()`. |

Do **not** add `.hermes.md` / `HERMES.md` (shadows this file).
`auth.json` under any Hermes home means Portal onboarding — remove; use Managed Scope.

Worker **provider/auth** is Managed Scope only. Seat pins live in factory
Managed Scope — implementer/orchestrator stay Qwen. Reviewer may pin MiniMax
only when dest-init saw a valid AD-008 escalation file (`HERMES_MINIMAX=1`).
Do not add `fallback_providers`. Never factory `model.default` MiniMax.

### Scope-stop

When evidence and intent diverge: stop the current scope, emit a typed block /
`needs_input`, and do not invent around the gap (pairs with `SOUL.md`).

On any gate refusal you **cannot** resolve within your `files_writable`,
emit a typed block and **stop**. Do not OOS-write, do not edit the refuser.
**Unclassifiable** is a legal outcome — typed `needs_input` + ESCALATE.

### Native worker protocol (hermes-kanban)

Workers never own lifecycle truth. End every turn with exactly one terminator:
`kanban_complete`, `kanban_request_review`, or `kanban_block`. A clean exit
without one is `protocol_violation`. **Implementer** happy path on M1/M2 is
`kanban_request_review` (reviewer=`reviewer`; K2 refuses the call without it); after it, end the turn — a
"nudge to finish" that arrives afterwards is already satisfied by the
review handoff, and answering it with `kanban_complete` is refused by K2.
On a loop card (M3, pinned `paved-road-m3`) there is no reviewer seat: the
implementer `kanban_complete`s once `advance.py` recorded ACCEPTED or
REVERTED for the card (K2 checks the loop record and that brief, run-verify
and advance ran in this log); a reverted attempt is done, its retry is the
next K4 card; DEFERRED is `kanban_block`. **Reviewer** `kanban_complete`
only after `assert-paved-road-audit.py` exits 0. `kanban_block` is external
escalation (MaaS 500, missing key, GPU), not a red paved-road step.
Mint proof is `kanban_request_review --metadata` `created_cards`
(empty list forbidden; KEEP + official log also prove mint). Implementer
does not `kanban_complete`. Serialize `kanban_create`. M2 PLAN and M4 VERDICT
use `--assignee implementer`. Do not mint dest factory cards. M3
uses `--assignee implementer`. Do not seat M2 or M4 on orchestrator
(dest `orchestrator.yaml.template` disables `file`/`terminal`/`skills`).
M4 `--body` is acceptance and oracles only (dest-4 `t_9acd47cb`). Do not
name `Token:` / `verdict:` `PROVISIONAL_ACCEPT`/`ACCEPT` or `ship:`.
`assert-m4-card-body.py` refuses a body that pre-specifies the verdict.
M4 `files_writable` is `evidence/verdicts/` (and other `evidence/` receipts);
the hook refuses `quarkus:add-extension` and product writes on phase M4.
Story `kanban_create` passes `--max-retries 1` (null inherits `failure_limit` 2
and masks a Gate K first failure). Mint those cards through
`.hermes/kernel/k4_mint.py` from K4 payloads (CLI `hermes kanban create`).
M3 argv also passes `--workspace dir:/projects/modernized`, `--skill` per
story, `--max-runtime 2h`, `--idempotency-key`, and `--parent` for the
M2 card (`HERMES_KANBAN_TASK`) plus the previous accepted loop card. K4
mints exactly one card per step: the head cluster (`M3 c:<cluster>`) or
`M4 VERIFY` when the work list is empty and nothing is deferred; every
card, M4 included, uses the receipt-bound key
`k4:<cluster>:<attempt>:<receipt16>`. Each accepted step is a commit
(`fix-until-green/scripts/advance.py`); there is no stamp card. Do not
dest-dispatch M4 without named Operator GO. Do not dest-commit dest-7.
After `--exec`, `kanban_request_review --metadata` `created_cards` is the
native `t_*` list (empty after a mint is OBJECT). Scratch workspace on a
story is REFUSE.
M1 KEEP evidence also `python3 .hermes/kernel/kanban_attach.py --task "$HERMES_KANBAN_TASK"`
(PVC paths stay; 25 MB/file). Do not `kanban decompose`. Do not `kanban swarm`
for serial T0. Do not run `hermes kanban daemon --force`.

When a tool result is `Blocked terminal` or `repeated_exact_failure_warning`,
there is no legal next command: `kanban_block --kind needs_input` naming that
command and its last refusal. Do not exit 0 with the card still running.

`hermes kanban block` marks the **card**, not the **process**. Seat ops
contain workers from outside the worker.

### The plan is the work list; the AI is not the planner of record

Spec Kit is removed (no `specify`, no `.specify/`, no spec/plan/tasks
files, no compatibility shim). Migration is one loop (SAD v3): the tools
compute a work list (MTA mandatory incidents, JDK compiler diagnostics,
failing tests, parity mismatches; clustered by file, fixed order), K4
mints one card for the head cluster, the worker edits only that cluster's
write set, `run-verify.sh` recomputes the list, and `advance.py` is a
transaction: it promotes only the issued card's candidate, exactly as
verified, inside the write set, on a strict decrease of the measure with
no new mandatory obligation (commit, next card); otherwise it discards the
candidate (index and working tree) and re-issues the cluster; at the ADR
threshold it defers to a human and the loop stops. Three sealed artifacts under
`evidence/planning/` (evidence-bundle → worklist → admission-receipt).
Ordering, verification, acceptance and termination are mechanical; a
worker may run the tools, edit inside its write set, report, and request
review — never author the list, the measure, or a decision. A missing
decision is an admission BLOCK (`kanban_block kind=needs_input`), not
something to infer.

Until `.hermes/pins.json` `pins.planner.activation` is `activated` (SAD §12
gate) — or `pilot` with an Operator seal bound to this exact evidence
bundle — M2 and downstream are unavailable: dest-init mints **M1 ANALYZE
only**, `assert-planner-activated.py` refuses M2, admission never ADMITS,
and K4 re-derives the same verdict from `pins.json` so a receipt cannot
bypass it. Do not invent a replacement path on a card. A worker never
creates or links cards (K2 vetoes `kanban_create`/`kanban_link` and
direct `hermes kanban create`); cards come from `k4_mint.py --exec`.

### Task-id correlation

Every Kanban task, commit prefix, session/log ref, domain-gate result, and
run-report line must carry the **same task id**.

### Work-list order

Clusters run in a fixed order: build file → configuration → compile
errors (leaf types first, from the JDK model) → remaining incidents →
tests → parity. One open card at a time; each accepted step is a commit.
IMPLEMENT workers must not re-plan. Authoritative:
`.hermes/planning/README.md` + `planner.worklist`.

### Standing conventions home

`AGENTS.md` is the **sole** standing-convention surface. Leave
`agent.coding_instructions` empty.

## Skill routers

One line each: what it governs → which skill. When a skill is loaded, prefer
`"${HERMES_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/…"`.

| Governs | Skill |
|---------|-------|
| M1 ANALYZE paved-road (primary pin) | `paved-road-m1` |
| M2 PLAN paved-road (primary pin) | `paved-road-m2` |
| M1 frozen input + digest (analysis copy for MTA) | `freeze-migration-input` |
| M1 repository build evidence | `capture-build-evidence` |
| M1 evidence bundle (root of the digest chain) | `assemble-evidence-bundle` |
| M2 deterministic compat-path baseline (pom, properties, main class) | `bootstrap-destination` |
| M2 the plan: tool-computed work list + baseline step | `build-worklist` |
| M2 admission receipt + activation gate | `admit-migration-plan` |
| M2 live board equals the loop's expected cards (K3) | `verify-live-kanban-loop` |
| M3 loop procedure (brief → edit → verify → accept/revert/defer) | `fix-until-green` |
| M4 source oracles + runtime parity receipt | `capture-source-oracles` |
| Story-class exit / oracle derivation | `derive-story-oracles` |
| G-1..G-4 measurement oracles | `check-domain-parity` |
| M4 VERIFY verdict JSON producer | `compose-m4-verdict` |
| M4/M5 verdict routing | `check-release-readiness` |
| M4 pinned-gate evidence (silence fails) | `assert-pinned-gates-ran` |
| M4 retrievable `src/` + `pom.xml` | `assert-retrievable-tree` |
| M3 harvest commit (not M4) | `commit-destination-tree` |
| Fence-evasion detector (not containment evidence) | `assert-no-fence-evasion` |
| Quarkus config / profiles | `configure-quarkus-profiles` |
| Entity / persistence form | `form-entity-persistence` |
| Entry-point + type inventory | `inventory-legacy-surface` |
| MTA analyze + findings handoff | `scan-with-mta` |
| Spring→Quarkus pattern cards | `spring-to-quarkus-patterns` |
| Quarkus extension add/rm | `manage-quarkus-extensions` |
| RH Quarkus POM structure | `reference-rh-quarkus-pom` |
| Destination Quarkus POM authoring | `author-destination-pom` |

## Governance

- **No `governance/` folder** on the tip. Pins: `.hermes/pins.json`.
- **Scope + exit are one concern** — each loop card carries its cluster's
  write set; `fix-until-green` runs the verifier and the measure decides.
- **Phase / verdict legality** is `compose-m4-verdict` (author
  `m4-verdict.json`) plus `check-release-readiness` (lint) plus native
  Kanban state — not a second dispatcher YAML.
- **Conservation** — every MTA incident is a work-list item (content-addressed,
  nothing dropped); the run cannot close while any mandatory item or any
  deferred cluster remains.
